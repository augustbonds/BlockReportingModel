TODO-list writing thesis, Monday August 14

1. write reasoning about solution #1
2. add append-adjustment, then reasoning about solution #2
3. write about stale replicas when trusting hashes

(5. write about using old style block report once every 24h or so) 
(4. write about conflict-free replicated datatypes) [x]


Target: 8 pages  (would result in 21)


Goal until Wednesday: 40 pages, OK to undershoot slightly.

On Tuesday evening, interview with OP5
Wednesday evening Draft hand-in.


At some point, have to do benchmarks. What benchmarks should i do?
(instead of benchmark, can do complexity analysis for different block report, partly already done, check blogpost in MasterThesisTools)
- Block reporting speed no concurrent modifications
