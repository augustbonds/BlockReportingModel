How block reports are processsed

A block report consists of a list of blocks with corresponding states.
It is created in FsDatasetImpl.getBlockReport() by looking at all blocks present in the in-memory map, and converting them into block report items according to the following logic:

if (state == FINALIZED)
	add block as finalized
if (state == RBW || state == RWR)
	add block as under construction
if (state == RUR)
	add original block (FINALIZED, RBW or RWR)
	//Keep in mind: RWR replicas were RBW replicas before a datanode restart happened
if (state == TEMPORARY)
	ignored.

According to this logic, the possible replica states in the block report are:
FINALIZED, RBW, RWR


Now over to the block report processing

If the namenode does not know of any replicas on the datanode, a special case processFirstBlockReport is invoked.

In all other cases, the same process takes place: processReport

PROCESS_REPORT

toAdd <- will contain all blocks that should be added to the namenode
toRemove <- will contain all blocks that should be removed from the namenode
toInvalidate <- will contain blocks which do not have referencing files anymore and should be deleted from datanodes
toCorrupt <- will contain blocks which are outdated or corrupt and should be deleted from the datanodes

reportDiff takes the report and the lists defined above, and populates them based on the report and the namenode state.





Block States
Block and Replica states serve different purposes.
Block states tell what the overall state of the block is, with respect to its different replicas, and the replica state tells what is the state of that specific replica.

There are four different Block states:
COMPLETE - The block has at least one FINALIZED replica and will not be modified
UNDER_CONSTRUCTION - The block is under construction meaning it has recently been allocated for write or append
UNDER_RECOVERY - The block was not complete when the client lease expired and has to be recovered
COMMITTED - The client has reported that all bytes have been written, but the datanodes have not reported any complete replicas yet.
